# Navet's Projectile Aimbot

### This script is a work in progress!

Every commit has a lua file you can get [here](https://github.com/uosq/lbox-projectile-aimbot/actions)

The only setting that you gotta configure in the Lmaobox menu is the aim key!

If LMAOBOX's projectile aimbot is enabled, this script will disabled it when shooting with a projectile weapon (we dont need 2 aimbots running at the same time, do we?)
