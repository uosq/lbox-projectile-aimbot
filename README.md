# Navet's Projectile Aimbot

### This project is archived

### There won't be a new update

Nothing is forever, but I hope you at least had some fun using it

Yes, you can use it, but there won't be any major updates (or any updates at all, unless a core feature is broken somehow)

If you want to fork it, go ahead do whatever you want with it, im not stopping you

---

Every commit has a lua file you can get [here](https://github.com/uosq/lbox-projectile-aimbot/actions)

The only setting that you gotta configure in the Lmaobox menu is the aim key!

If LMAOBOX's projectile aimbot is enabled, this script will disabled it when shooting with a projectile weapon (we dont need 2 aimbots running at the same time, do we?)
